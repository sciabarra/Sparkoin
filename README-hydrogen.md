# Hydrogen and Jupyter

This kit installs the python based Jupyter Notebook together with a Scala 2.11 plugin.

To use jupyter just use bin/jupyter.sh and it will start a web browser with REPL for evaluating Scala Code in your browser.

But the nicest thing is Hydrogen a plugin for Atom, that gives you the same thing inside your source code.

Open a Scala source and write some valid Scala expressions, then highlight it.

Typing Alt-Shift-Enter it will evaluate and display the result in your editor!
