# Ensime-Atom

This kit installs ensime and atom.

You need Atom Installed. You need also sbt, either locally installed or merged from the `embedded-sbt` branch.

To use it all you need to do is to run `bin/atom.sh` and then start Ensime with the command `Ensime: Start`.

You will enjoy completions graciously offered from Ensime.
